Lonchera is a Telegram bot that interacts with the LunchMoney API to manage
and track expenses, income, and financial goals.

The package manager used is `uv`. All changes made to the code should be followed
by running:

```bash
uv run ruff format .
uv run ruff check .
```

Use type hints as much as possible.
